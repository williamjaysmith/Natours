# Natours Application

Natours is a full-stack tour booking web app crammed with tons of modern technologies such as Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB/Mongoose. It follows the MVC architecture. It has some nice features such as Mapbox for pinning locations, Stripe for payments, Brevo for emailing.

This app was a blast to build. Given more time, I would love to come back and make the pages more responsive, add a few more features for filtering tours and create an even better experience.
